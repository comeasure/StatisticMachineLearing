# StatisticMachineLearing


This project focuses on using various machine learning models to classify songs based on their attributes. The dataset is balanced using SMOTE and several preprocessing steps are applied before training and evaluating multiple classifiers.

## Project Structure

- `training_data.csv`: Training data file. (open sourse)
- `songs_to_classify.csv`: Test data file to be classified. (open sourse)
- `script.py`: Main script for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the models.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
